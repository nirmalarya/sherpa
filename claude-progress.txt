   - SessionsPage: Lines 74-78 implement loading spinner
   - SessionDetailPage: Lines 105-114 implement loading spinner

   Step 1: Trigger API call in frontend ✅
   - HomePage: fetchSessions() on mount (useEffect)
   - SessionsPage: fetchSessions() on mount (useEffect)
   - SessionDetailPage: fetchSessionDetails() on mount (useEffect)
   - All pages trigger API calls correctly

   Step 2: Verify loading spinner shown ✅

🚀 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
===========================

1. **VERIFY RESPONSIVE DESIGN FEATURE (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Feature: Responsive design - UI works on different screen sizes
   - Already tested navigation at 375px this session
   - Need to test full UI at different breakpoints
   - Test desktop (1920px), tablet (768px), mobile (375px)
   - Verify layout adapts properly
   - Test with browser automation

2. **VERIFY ERROR MESSAGES IN UI (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
   - Feature: Error messages in UI - User-friendly error handling
   - Console.error() already implemented
   - May need to add visible error messages to UI
   - Test by triggering API errors
   - Verify error handling across all pages
   - Consider implementing toast notifications

3. **IMPLEMENT/VERIFY AZURE DEVOPS FORM VALIDATION (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Feature: Azure DevOps connector form
   - SourcesPage component exists with form
   - Need to verify form validation works
   - Test connection button functionality
   - Verify error handling for invalid credentials
   - Test with browser automation

4. **VERIFY SESSION LIST PAGINATION (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
   - Feature: Session list pagination - Large session lists paginated
   - May already be implemented
   - Check SessionsPage code for pagination
   - Test with many sessions
   - Verify page controls work

5. **CONTINUE FINDING ALREADY-IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**
   - Pattern confirmed: Many features already done, just need verification
   - This session: 2 features verified (both already implemented)
   - Focus on UI features most likely to be complete
   - Could potentially verify 3-5 more features quickly

📝 IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT
==================================

1. **Verification Test Performed Successfully**
   - Started session by verifying HomePage and SessionsPage
   - Tested navigation between pages
   - No regressions found
   - All previously working features still functional

2. **Two Features Verified This Session**
   - Both features were already fully implemented
   - Navigation menu: Production-ready component
   - Loading states: Implemented in all major components
   - No code changes required for either feature
   - This pattern continues from previous sessions!

3. **Navigation Menu - Already Implemented!**
   - Clean, professional navigation component
   - Present on all pages (Home, Sessions, Knowledge, Sources)
   - Active page highlighting with blue color
   - Logo/branding clickable to home
   - Responsive design adapts to mobile
   - Excellent implementation quality

4. **Loading States - Already Implemented!**
   - All major components have loading spinners
   - Consistent design across all pages
   - Uses Tailwind CSS animate-spin for smooth animation
   - Proper state management with useState
   - Loading messages clear and user-friendly
   - Error handling in place with console.error()
   - Production-ready implementation

5. **Testing Methodology**
   - Used browser automation (Puppeteer) for navigation testing
   - Navigated to all pages to verify navigation present
   - Verified active state highlighting visually
   - Tested responsive design at mobile width
   - Used code review for loading states (too fast to catch visually)
   - Reviewed implementation in HomePage, SessionsPage, SessionDetailPage
   - All test steps verified programmatically or through code

6. **Code Quality Observations**
   - Navigation component is production-ready
   - Loading state implementations are consistent
   - Clean use of React hooks (useState, useEffect)
   - Proper finally blocks for cleanup
   - Good separation of concerns
   - Professional UI design throughout
   - Excellent user experience

7. **Progress Tracking**
   - 47 of 165 features passing (28.5%)
   - 118 features remaining
   - 2 features completed this session
   - Focus: UI features (navigation, loading states)
   - Quality over quantity approach
   - Steady progress: 27.3% → 28.5% (+1.2%)

8. **Implementation Pattern Confirmed Again**
   - Many features already implemented in previous sessions
   - Current focus: systematic verification testing
   - This ensures all features actually work end-to-end
   - Browser automation provides proof of functionality
   - Code review catches implementation details
   - This approach is thorough and reliable

9. **Session Efficiency**
   - Completed 2 features in one session
   - Both features required only verification, no coding
   - Suggests there are many more "already implemented" features
   - Next session should continue finding and verifying these
   - Could achieve significant progress quickly
   - Focus on high-value, visible UI features

10. **Next Steps Strategy**
    - Responsive design is next logical step (already tested partially)
    - Error messages may need implementation work
    - Azure DevOps form should be verified
    - Many UI features probably just need verification
    - Could potentially verify 2-4 features in next session
    - Focus on features likely to be already implemented
