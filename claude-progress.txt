🚀 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
===========================

1. **VERIFY IMAGE OPTIMIZATION FEATURE (NEXT PRIORITY)**
   - Feature: Image optimization - Properly sized and compressed images
   - Next in feature_list.json after Responsive breakpoints
   - Test steps: Review image usage, verify sizes, compression, lazy loading, alt text
   - Should be quick - verify if images are used, add alt text if needed
   - May be N/A if no images used in app (just logo)

2. **VERIFY LOGO AND BRANDING FEATURE (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Feature: Logo and branding - SHERPA branding consistent
   - Test logo usage, visibility, navigation, colors, voice
   - Already have logo in navigation (SHERPA V1)
   - Should be quick verification

3. **CONTINUE PATTERN: VERIFY ALREADY-IMPLEMENTED STYLE FEATURES**
   - Session 34: 4 features verified
