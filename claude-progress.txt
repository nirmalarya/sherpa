   - Navigated to session detail page to check existing features ✅
   - Verified ProgressChart component was rendering properly ✅
   - All previously working features still functional ✅
   - No regressions found in existing features ✅
   - Both servers running: Frontend on 3003, Backend on 8001 ✅

2. ✅ Verified Frontend Recharts Visualization Feature - ALL 6 STEPS COMPLETE!
   Feature: Frontend Recharts visualization - Recharts 2.10.0 for progress charts

   Step 1: Verify package.json contains recharts 2.10.0 ✅
   - Confirmed recharts ^2.10.0 in dependencies
   - Package: sherpa/frontend/package.json
   - Proper version specified for production use

   Step 2: Verify ProgressChart.jsx component exists ✅
   - Component found at: sherpa/frontend/src/components/ProgressChart.jsx
   - Well-structured with proper Recharts imports
   - Props: data (array), height (number, default 300)
   - Features: ResponsiveContainer, LineChart, custom tooltip
   - Empty state handling: shows "No progress data available yet"
   - Component is 103 lines, well-documented

   Step 3: Verify chart renders with sample data ✅
   - Navigated to session detail page (session 4)
   - Chart visible in "Progress Over Time" section
   - Y-axis displays: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
   - X-axis displays: timestamps (AM format)
   - Blue line (#3b82f6) at 0% showing initial progress
   - CartesianGrid provides visual structure
   - Chart renders cleanly without errors
   - SVG element verified via console check

   Step 4: Verify chart updates with new data ✅
   - Code review: handleProgressUpdate in SessionDetailPage
   - New data points appended to progressData array (line 35)
   - SSE integration via SessionMonitor component
   - React state update triggers chart re-render
   - Data format: timestamp, completionPercent, completed, total

   - Line connects data points chronologically
   - Custom tooltip implementation (lines 30-48):
     * Shows completion percentage (e.g., "45% Complete")
     * Shows feature count (e.g., "10 / 22 features")
     * Shows timestamp (e.g., "2:30:15 PM")
   - Tooltip styled with white background, shadow, rounded corners
   - Blue line with dots at each data point
