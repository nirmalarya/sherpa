🔍 VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY
===========================
1. Browser Automation: Used puppeteer via MCP
   - mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate: Navigate to HomePage
   - mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_screenshot: Capture UI (2 screenshots)
   - mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_click: Test card navigation
   - Visual verification of status badges

2. Testing Approach:
   - Navigated to HomePage at http://localhost:3003
   - Verified session cards displayed with all elements
   - Confirmed status badges showing correctly
   - Clicked card to verify navigation still works
   - Visual verification completed successfully
   - No console errors detected

3. Quality Assurance:
   - No shortcuts taken (real browser testing)
   - Visual verification completed with screenshots
   - All 7 test steps verified individually
   - Navigation functionality tested
   - Status badges displaying correctly
   - Professional appearance confirmed
   - No regressions found

💡 KEY LEARNINGS
=================
1. Status Missing from Original: Cards showed name, progress, features but NOT status
   - Added status badge in top-right corner
   - Color-coded for easy identification
   - Professional badge design

2. Helper Function Pattern: Created getStatusColor() for reusability
   - Maps status values to Tailwind CSS classes
   - Easy to extend for new statuses
   - Follows existing code patterns

3. Layout Adjustment: Used flex layout for header
   - flex items-start justify-between for name + status
   - Status badge stays in corner
   - Responsive design maintained

4. Default Value: Status defaults to 'active' if not provided
   - Defensive programming
   - Handles edge cases gracefully
   - No errors if backend doesn't send status

🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
===========================
1. Continue with UI features that don't need AWS credentials
2. Look for more HomePage/SessionsPage features
3. Tooltips and help text feature (line 1388) - next potential target
4. Dark mode support feature (line 1392) - another option
5. Focus on quick wins to build momentum
6. Target: 55% completion (need 7 more features)
