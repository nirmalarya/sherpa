🚀 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
===========================

1. **VERIFY ANIMATIONS AND TRANSITIONS FEATURE (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Feature: Animations and transitions - Smooth, purposeful motion
   - Already implemented: Modal animations (fadeIn, slideUp from Session 41)
   - Already seen: Card hover transitions (transition-shadow)
   - Already seen: Progress bar transitions (transition-all)
   - Test steps: smooth transitions, appropriate duration, enhance UX, reduced motion
   - Quick verification task
   - Likely already complete or mostly complete

2. **CONTINUE PATTERN: VERIFY ALREADY-IMPLEMENTED STYLE FEATURES**
   - Session 34: 4 features verified
   - Session 35: 2 features verified
