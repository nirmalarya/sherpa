🚨 KNOWN ISSUES
================

1. **API Integration in Page Components Still Pending**
   - Original HomePage.jsx, SessionsPage.jsx, etc. exist but cause issues
   - Currently using simplified HomePage-simple.jsx
   - Need to debug and restore full API integration
   - This is the next priority for frontend work

2. **Port Configuration**
   - Documentation says port 3001, actually running on 3003
   - Ports 3001 and 3002 are occupied
   - Backend correctly configured for port 8001

3. **Temporary Files Need Cleanup**
   - App-test.jsx, main-debug.jsx should be removed
   - public/ directory untracked
   - test_db.py untracked

🚀 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
===========================

1. **IMPLEMENT NEXT FEATURE: HomePage Component with API Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   Feature #426 in feature_list.json:
   - Restore full HomePage component with API calls
   - Fetch active sessions from /api/sessions endpoint
   - Display sessions as cards with progress bars
   - Show recent activity feed
   - Make "New Session" and "Generate Files" buttons functional
   - Test thoroughly through browser automation
   - Mark as passing after verification

2. **LOAD BUILT-IN SNIPPETS INTO DATABASE**
   - Create snippet loader module
   - Parse markdown files from sherpa/snippets/
   - Insert all 7 snippets into database
   - Verify via GET /api/snippets endpoint

3. **IMPLEMENT SessionsPage COMPONENT**
   Feature #439: List all sessions with table, filters, and search
   - Display all sessions in table format
   - Add status filters (active, complete, error)
   - Add search functionality
   - Make rows clickable to navigate to detail page

4. **CLEANUP TEMPORARY FILES**
   - Remove App-test.jsx, main-debug.jsx
   - Add to .gitignore or delete
   - Clean up any other debugging artifacts

5. **DOCUMENT ACTUAL PORT CONFIGURATION**
   - Update any documentation referencing port 3001
   - Document actual ports (3003 for frontend, 8001 for backend)

📝 IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT
==================================

1. **Verification Test Performed Successfully**
   - Started session by verifying existing passing features
   - No regressions found
   - All previously working features still functional

2. **Systematic Approach Worked Well**
   - Focused on verifying infrastructure features first
   - Thoroughly tested each feature before marking as passing
   - Used browser automation for all verification
   - Took screenshots at each step

3. **Frontend Infrastructure Solid**
   - All core frontend setup complete and verified
   - React, Vite, Tailwind, Router all working
   - Icons, Axios, file structure all correct
   - Ready to build actual page components

4. **Next Focus: Actual Page Components**
   - Infrastructure is done
   - Now need to implement actual functionality
   - Start with HomePage (feature #426)
   - Then move to SessionsPage, SessionDetailPage, etc.

5. **Testing Requirements**
   - MUST use browser automation for all verification
   - MUST take screenshots to verify visual appearance
   - MUST test complete user workflows end-to-end
   - ONLY mark features as passing after thorough verification

6. **Git Best Practices**
   - Keep commits focused and descriptive
   - Only commit when features are fully working
   - Update progress notes after each session
   - Leave codebase in clean, working state

7. **Python Environment**
   - MUST use Python 3.12 (venv-312)
   - Backend on port 8001
   - Use venv-312/bin/python3.12 for all operations

8. **Progress Tracking**
   - 10 of 165 features passing (6.1%)
   - 155 features remaining
   - Focus on one feature at a time
   - Quality over quantity
