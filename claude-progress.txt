💡 KEY LEARNINGS
=================
1. ARIA Best Practices:
   - Use aria-label for concise labels on interactive elements
   - Use aria-labelledby to reference existing heading text
   - Use aria-describedby for longer descriptions
   - Mark decorative icons with aria-hidden="true"
   - Use .sr-only for text that's only for screen readers
   - Role attributes complement semantic HTML
   - Progress bars need aria-valuenow, min, and max

2. Keyboard Navigation:
   - All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
   - Focus indicators must be clearly visible (2px+ outline)
   - Skip-to-main link helps keyboard users
   - Tab order should follow visual flow
   - Modal dialogs need focus trap (return focus on close)
   - Command palette needs arrow key navigation
   - Escape key should close modals consistently

3. Semantic HTML:
   - Use <nav>, <main>, <footer> for landmarks
   - Use <section> with headings for content areas
   - Use <time> with datetime for timestamps
   - Use <ul>/<li> for lists, not div elements
   - Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
   - Skip link should be first focusable element
   - Semantic elements improve SEO and accessibility

4. Focus Management:
   - Use focus:ring-2 and focus:ring-offset-2 for Tailwind
   - Use *:focus-visible for global fallback
   - Use outline-none carefully (always add alternative focus style)
   - Focus rings should use brand color for consistency
   - Focus indicators should be 2px minimum for visibility
   - Skip link should appear at top when focused
   - Button focus styles should match link focus styles

5. Screen Reader Support:
   - ARIA labels make UI understandable to screen readers
   - Role attributes provide context for widget types
   - Aria-live regions announce dynamic content changes
   - Hidden headings provide structure without visual clutter
   - Time elements with datetime provide machine-readable dates
   - Proper list markup announces item count to users
   - Dialog roles trap screen reader focus appropriately

🎯 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
===========================
1. Logging implementation (line 1556) - structured logging
2. Database migrations (line 1568) - schema versioning
3. API versioning (line 1580) - /v1/ endpoints
4. Rate limiting (line 1584) - prevent API abuse
5. Input validation (line 1596) - comprehensive validation
6. Target: 59% completion (need 2 more features)
