   - 124 features remaining
   - 3 features completed this session
   - Focus: KnowledgePage snippet functionality
   - Quality over quantity approach
   - Steady progress: 23.0% → 24.8% (+1.8%)

9. **Implementation Pattern Confirmed**
   - Many features already implemented in previous sessions
   - Current focus: systematic verification testing
   - This ensures all features actually work end-to-end
   - Browser automation provides proof of functionality
   - Screenshots document visual appearance and behavior
   - This approach catches edge cases and bugs early

10. **Code Quality Observations**
    - SnippetBrowser is production-ready
    - Search implementation is efficient (client-side filtering)
    - Modal implementation follows best practices
    - Copy functionality uses modern browser APIs

    - Clean JSX structure
    - Proper event handling
    - Excellent user experience throughout

11. **Session Efficiency**
    - Completed 3 features in one session
    - All features required only verification, no coding
    - Suggests there are many more "already implemented" features
    - Next session should focus on finding and verifying these
    - Could achieve significant progress quickly

12. **Next Steps Strategy**
    - Continue finding UI features that are likely implemented
    - Session controls (pause/stop/resume) are next high priority
    - Real-time SSE updates also critical for monitoring
    - Many UI features probably just need verification
    - Could potentially verify 5-10 features in next session
