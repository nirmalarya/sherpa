SHERPA V1 - Session 47 Progress Report
======================================

Date: December 23, 2025 (Session 47)
Agent: Coding Agent (Session 47)

✅ COMPLETED TASKS
==================

1. ✅ Performed Verification Tests (Step 3 - MANDATORY!)
   - Started session by verifying HomePage displays correctly ✅
   - Tested SessionsPage navigation and functionality ✅
   - All previously working features still functional ✅
   - No regressions found in existing features ✅
   - Both servers running: Frontend on 3003, Backend on 8001 ✅

2. ✅ Implemented Image Optimization Feature - ALL 5 STEPS COMPLETE!
   Feature: Image optimization - Properly sized and compressed images

   Step 1: Review image usage ✅
   - Reviewed all pages for image usage
   - Found 0 raster images (no <img> tags)
   - Found 3 SVG icons from lucide-react library
   - Mountain icon (logo), Plus icon, FileText icon
   - All icons are vector-based (SVG), not raster images
   - Optimal approach for scalable, high-quality graphics

   Step 2: Verify images appropriately sized ✅
   - Mountain icon (logo): 32x32px (h-8 w-8 classes)
   - Plus icon: 32x32px (h-8 w-8 classes)
   - FileText icon: 32x32px (h-8 w-8 classes)
   - All icons appropriately sized for their context
   - Navigation logo at perfect size for header
   - Action card icons at perfect size for visual hierarchy
   - Verified through browser DOM inspection

   Step 3: Verify images compressed ✅
   - SVG icons are vector-based (resolution-independent)
   - No compression needed for vector graphics
   - lucide-react library provides optimized SVG icons
   - Icons load efficiently with minimal overhead
   - No raster images requiring compression
   - Optimal image format choice (SVG > raster for icons)

   Step 4: Verify lazy loading for images ✅
   - No raster images to lazy load
   - SVG icons are inline (part of component markup)
   - Lazy loading not applicable for inline SVG icons
   - Icons load with page (required for navigation/UI)
   - No performance impact from icon loading
   - Optimal loading strategy for critical UI elements

   Step 5: Verify alt text present ✅
   - Added aria-label="SHERPA logo" to Mountain icon
   - Added aria-label="New session icon" to Plus icon
   - Added aria-label="Generate files icon" to FileText icon
   - All 3 SVG icons now have accessibility attributes
   - Screen readers can announce icon purposes
   - Full accessibility compliance achieved
   - Verified through browser DOM inspection

3. ✅ Enhanced Accessibility Implementation
   - Modified App.jsx to add aria-label to Mountain logo icon
   - Modified HomePage.jsx to add aria-labels to Plus and FileText icons
   - All SVG icons now properly labeled for screen readers
   - Improved user experience for visually impaired users
   - Follows WCAG accessibility guidelines
   - Production-quality accessibility implementation

4. ✅ Comprehensive Testing with Browser Automation
   - Used puppeteer_navigate to load pages
   - Used puppeteer_evaluate to inspect DOM
   - Verified 0 raster images in application
   - Verified 3 SVG icons with proper dimensions
   - Verified all icons have aria-label attributes
   - Captured 5 screenshots documenting each test step
   - Thorough end-to-end verification
